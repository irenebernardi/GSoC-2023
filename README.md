Auditory Steady-State Response (ASSR) refers to the cortical entrainment to frequency and phase of an auditory signal that is presented in a fixed “train of clicks”, in a gamma range rhythm (40 Hz). A hallmark of schizophrenia is a reduction in ASSR; this project aims at reproducing this phenomenon using an auditory cortex (A1) model with thalamocortical connectivity. The latter simulates a cortical column with a depth of 2000 μm and 200 μm diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. We will refer to in-vivo data showing the effects of increased CB1 receptor availability and GABA receptor deficits, as these have been linked to the EEG abnormalities that characterize schizophrenia. We will start by running batch simulation tasks to pull out connectivity rules from the A1 model, modifying GABA and CB1 Receptors. This step will be run on a scaled version of the A1. Then, we will analyze parameter sweeps for local field potentials, using the LFPy toolbox. As our ultimate goal is helping adopt NetPyNE and making the batch NetPyNE toolkit more accessible, documentation will be made available on a deployed site for every step of the process.
